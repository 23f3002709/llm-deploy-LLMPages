Ashravan woke to the soft breath of morning, the palace murmuring as if it, too, tested the shape of its memory. Candles guttered in niches where servants had kept vigil. He could recall the taste of ink, the pattern of tiles two halls away, the names of ministers whose laughter had always hidden a blade. He could not recall the moment before waking.

Shai had warned him there would be seams. He found them like hairline cracks in porcelain: certain recollections that rang too clear, too perfect, as though polished. He accepted them, and yet he feared them. What was a man who doubted the truth of his own breath?

The court arrived in petals of silk and tension. The Regent smiled the way a cobra smiled. Ashravan listened to reports of provinces and border fires, to the careful arrangements of ceremony designed to constrain him. Rumor had made him a puppet; truth threatened to make him a ghost.

That night he walked alone among the galleries. Portraits of emperors watched him with painted patience. His steps echoed off stone, and with each echo he felt the rhythm of a life both forged and chosen. He was an Emperor whose soul had been mended by art—an art that admitted its lies so a greater truth might stand.

He met Shai in the shadow of a half-finished mural. Color stained her fingers. "There will be tests," she said softly. "Some will try to break you on the rumor of what I did. Some will try to break me on the truth that I did it."

The test came at dawn. A minister whose smile was a seam in leather unveiled a decree that would bind the provinces to the Regent’s hand, and bind the Regent to Ashravan’s, in a knot that only strangled upward. It was neat, clever, and it bought the empire a future that belonged to someone else.

Ashravan let silence stretch until it thinned. Then he reached for the imperial seal. He held it above the decree so all could witness the weight of his choice. "We do not mend in order to remain broken," he said.

Somewhere, he knew, a seam would crack. Perhaps in him. Perhaps in the story the empire told of itself.

He brought the seal down—not upon the decree, but upon a sheet he had carried in hidden folds. A counter-edict, authored in the night, which unraveled the knot and named each plotter by name. The sound that followed was not the thump of wax; it was the splintering of a design that had assumed he would be hollow.

The court erupted. The Regent rose, a hiss of silk, and the room tilted toward violence. Ashravan stood, steady as the pillar he had decided to be. "If you would break me," he said, "do it in the open. If you would break the empire, learn that I am not made to shatter."

The climax was a blade drawn and a dozen secrets shedding their masks. When it ended, the room held its breath and found it belonged to him. Not because his soul had been perfect, but because he had chosen where to let it be true.
